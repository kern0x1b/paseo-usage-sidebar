 * the daemon and replayed the `provider.usage.list` handshake by hand, because
 * 0.7 gave plugins no usage API. That path is unreachable under the new
 * requirement, and it was the only reason server code depended on the DOM's
 * `WebSocket`/`MessageEvent`/`CloseEvent` globals, so it is gone along with the
 * `PASEO_USAGE_SIDEBAR_HOST` override and the config.json endpoint probing.
